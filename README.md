# Remote-Sensing-Data-Analysis-Using-R
### Images are from MODIS Satellite.
### Parameters found are:
### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): 
Used to analyze remote sensing measurements from a space platform, and assess whether the target being observed is live green vegetation
or not.

### Enhanced vegetation index (EVI): 
The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) is an ‘optimized’ vegetation index designed to enhance the vegetation signal with improved sensitivity
in high biomass regions and improved vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in 
atmosphere influences.

### Normalized difference Water index (NDWI): 
It is used to monitor changes in water content of leaves, using near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths.
